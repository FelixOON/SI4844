## Your support is important.

If you would like to support this library development, consider joining this project via Github. Thank you!

## About the SI4844 Architecture 

The Si4844 is an analog-tuned digital-display AM/FM/SW radio receiver. It has an analog-tune while frequency, band, and setero/mono information can be displayed on LCD. It works with a I2C protocol that allows a microcontroller send command and receive data. 

See more about SI4844 on [BROADCAST ANALOG TUNING DIGITAL DISPLAY AM/FM/SW RADIO RECEIVER](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/Si4840-44-A10.pdf) 


## Library Installation

You can install the library is via the Arduino Library Manager. Go to the menu __Sketch__ > __Include Library__ > __Manage Libraries...__, and in the search box,  type __"PU2CLR SI4844"__.

The images below show that actions

## Hardware Requirements and Setup

This library has been written for the Arduino platform and has been successfully tested on Pro Mini. I beleave it will wotk on any other Arduino with I2C support.

The SI4844 is a +3.3 V only part. If you are not using a +3.3 V version of Arduino, you have to use a converter.

To use this labrary you need to build a radio based on SI4844 coneccted to Arduino. The schematic and photos below show the hardware and setup requirments for start using this library.

### Schematic

The signal amplifier was not required fo test.

The document [BROADCAST ANALOG TUNING DIGITAL DISPLAY AM/FM/SW RADIO RECEIVER](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/Si4840-44-A10.pdf), chapter two, page 11,  has a typical application schematic.

### SI4844 soldered on adapter


It was a bit hard to solder the Si4844 on adapter. However, by using a electronic magnifier it was possible.
