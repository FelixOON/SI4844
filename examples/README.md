# Examples of using the SI4844 Library for Arduino

This folder has a set of examples that might help you in your project.


## Examples Sumarry

1. Minimal Radio with SI4844
2. Proof of Concept


## Minimal Radio with SI4844 (SI4844_MINIMAL)

The [SI4844_MINIMAL.ino](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4844/blob/master/examples/SI4844_MINIMAL/SI4844_MINIMAL.ino) is a sketch with just 35 lines. It is enough to make a simple radio based on SI4844.  


## Proof of Concept

The [SI4844_POC.ino](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4844/blob/master/examples/SI4844_POC/SI4844_POC.ino) is a proof of concept for SI4844 controlled by Arduino and the SI4844 Library. This Arduino Sketch only works on your IDE (Arduino IDE). However, you can replace the Serial Monitor functions that deal the SI4844 and arduino with functions that will manipulate the LCD, encoder and push buttons appropriated for your project.  


## Extended SW band frequency ranges from 2.3–5.6 MHz and 22–28.5 MHz 

The sketch [SI4844_CUSTOM_BAND.ino](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4844/blob/master/examples/SI4844_POC/SI4844_CUSTOM_BAND.ino) show how to extend a SW band frequency ranges. You can define band from from 2.3–5.6 MHz and 22–28.5 MHz.
