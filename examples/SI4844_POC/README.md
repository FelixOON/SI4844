# Proof of Concept for SI4844 Arduino Library 


## About this POC.

This project is a proof of concept for SI4844 controlled by Arduino and the SI4844 Library. Arduino Sketch only works on your IDE (Arduino IDE). However, you can replace the Serial Monitor functions that deal the SI4844 and arduino with functions that will manipulate the LCD, encoder and push buttons appropriated for your project.  

There is extensive documentation in the sketch that can guide you on how to adapt the code to your own project.
